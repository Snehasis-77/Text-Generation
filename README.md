# Text-Generation

Here’s a complete step-by-step guide to run a GPT project with a UI using Google Colab and Gradio:

Step 1: Set up Google Colab
Open your browser and go to Google Colab.
Create a new notebook by clicking on File > New Notebook.
Step 2: Install Necessary Libraries
You'll need to install the Huggingface Transformers library for the GPT model and Gradio for creating a UI.

In a new Colab cell, enter the following command to install the required libraries:

bash
Copy code
!pip install transformers gradio
This command installs the Huggingface Transformers library (for the GPT model) and Gradio (for the UI).

Run the cell by clicking the play button next to it or pressing Shift + Enter.

Step 3: Import the Libraries
After installation, import the necessary libraries:

python
Copy code
import gradio as gr
from transformers import pipeline
transformers: Used to load the GPT model.
gradio: Used to create the UI.
Run the cell.

Step 4: Load the GPT-2 Model
Use Huggingface’s pipeline to load a pre-trained GPT-2 model:

python
Copy code
generator = pipeline('text-generation', model='gpt2')
This loads the GPT-2 model and prepares it to generate text based on a prompt. If you want to use a different GPT model (e.g., GPT-3 or custom models), you can adjust the model name accordingly.

Run the cell to load the model. It may take some time to download the model to Colab.

Step 5: Define a Function to Generate Text
Now, define a function that generates text based on user input (prompt). This function uses the GPT model to generate text.

python
Copy code
def generate_text(prompt):
    result = generator(prompt, max_length=100, num_return_sequences=1)
    return result[0]['generated_text']
Here, the function:

Takes a prompt (input text) from the user.
Uses the GPT model to generate text with a maximum length of 100 characters.
Returns the generated text to the user.
Run the cell.

Step 6: Create the Gradio Interface
Now, use Gradio to create a simple web-based interface for interacting with the GPT model:

python
Copy code
gr_interface = gr.Interface(
    fn=generate_text,            # The function to call (text generator)
    inputs="text",               # The input type (user provides text)
    outputs="text",              # The output type (returns generated text)
    title="GPT-2 Text Generator",  # Title of the app
    description="Enter a prompt and the model will generate text."
)
This defines the UI:

fn: Specifies the function (generate_text) that generates text from the model.
inputs: Specifies that the input will be text (user input).
outputs: Specifies that the output will also be text (model output).
title: The title of the UI.
description: A brief description of what the app does.
Run the cell to define the interface.

Step 7: Launch the Interface
Launch the Gradio interface using the following code:

python
Copy code
gr_interface.launch()
Run the cell. This will create a web-based interface that you can interact with in the Colab notebook. Gradio will provide a shareable link for others to access your app as well.

Step 8: Interact with the Model
After launching the interface, a Gradio window will appear with:

A text input box where you can enter your prompt.
A generate button to generate the text.
An output box where the generated text will appear.
Enter any prompt (e.g., “Once upon a time...”) and click the generate button. The model will generate text based on your input.

Step 9: Save Your Notebook to GitHub (Optional)
If you want to save your Colab notebook to GitHub:

Click on File > Save a copy in GitHub.
Provide the repository name and select whether it’s public or private.
Add a description if necessary and click OK.
Your notebook will be pushed to your GitHub repository.

Final Complete Code Example
python
Copy code
!pip install transformers gradio

import gradio as gr
from transformers import pipeline

# Load GPT-2 model for text generation
generator = pipeline('text-generation', model='gpt2')

# Function to generate text
def generate_text(prompt):
    result = generator(prompt, max_length=100, num_return_sequences=1)
    return result[0]['generated_text']

# Define Gradio UI
gr_interface = gr.Interface(fn=generate_text, 
                            inputs="text", 
                            outputs="text", 
                            title="GPT-2 Text Generator", 
                            description="Enter a prompt and the model will generate text.")

# Launch the interface
gr_interface.launch()
Optional Customization Ideas:
Change Model: You can use other GPT models like gpt-3 or custom Huggingface models.
UI Improvements: Customize the Gradio interface with more input/output options, upload buttons, etc.
Other UIs: You could use Streamlit for a more interactive UI if you prefer that over Gradio.
This should give you a solid foundation for running a GPT project with a simple UI on Google Colab!
